This folder contains the basic frontend code in order to embed Video Indexer's widgets in your own service and examples for the output json file you will recieve using our API.

The widgets are divided to player and insight widgets and their documentation and a way to embed them in your app can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-embed-widgets).

For more detailed examples, please visit our [Codepen page](https://codepen.io/videoindexer/)
